	Explain 
Branches are a very important part of git.
Branching allows to make a "copy" of your working project and change it without affecting(saameynaya "affectant") the main branch (master branch), giving an opportunity()
to work on the same project with different commits
When you want to add a new feature(fonctionnalité) or fix a bug(punaise)
-no matter how big or how small - you create a new branch to encapsulate your changes.

Creating a new branch is done using the branch command:
git branch my_new_branch

Then we need to switch to the branch using the checkout command:
git checkout my_new_branch

Then we need to switch to the branch using the checkout command:
git checkout -b my_new_branch

Now, every change made in the new branch called my_new_branch won't effect the master branch.
