/* 
While many programming languages support arrays with named indexes (text instead of numbers), called associative arrays, JavaScript does not.
However, you still can use the named array syntax, which will produce an object.

var person = []; //empty array
person["name"] = "John";
person["age"] = 46;
document.write(person["age"]);

Now, person is treated as an object, instead of being an array.
